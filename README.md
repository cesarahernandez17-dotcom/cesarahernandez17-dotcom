# Hi, I'm César 👋

I build **AI automations and agents** for PYMEs — intelligent chatbots, RAG with local business data, agents for sales/stock/customer service, integrations with WhatsApp, Mercado Libre, AFIP.

Most of my work is hands-on: real Python code, n8n/Make workflows, LangChain/LangGraph setups, and tested MVPs you can clone → install → run right away.

I focus on practical, low-cost solutions using open-source models (Gemini Flash, Llama, Groq) to help small and medium businesses save time and money with AI.

## What I work on

- AI Agents: single-agent, multi-agent, tool calling, memory, browser/voice agents  
- RAG setups: chat with PDFs/Excel/Google Sheets, hybrid search, local RAG  
- Automations for PYMEs: lead scoring, stock prediction, WhatsApp bots, CRM AI  
- Ready-to-run templates: clone my repos for quick starts  
- GenAI in retail & streaming: personalized marketing, customer support assistants, demand forecasting, user retention analytics
