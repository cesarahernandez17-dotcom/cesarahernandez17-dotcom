Hi, I'm César 👋  
I build **AI automations and agents** for PYMEs in Argentina — chatbots inteligentes, RAG with local data, agents for sales/stock/customer service, integrations with WhatsApp/Mercado Libre/AFIP.

Most of my work is hands-on: real Python code, n8n/Make workflows, LangChain/LangGraph setups, and tested MVPs you can clone → install → run right away.

I focus on practical, low-cost solutions using open-source models (Gemini Flash, Llama, Groq) to help small businesses save time and money with AI.

What I work on  
- AI Agents: single/multi-agent, tool calling, memory, browser/voice agents  
- RAG setups: chat with PDFs/Excel/Google Sheets, hybrid search, local RAG  
- Automations for PYMEs: lead scoring, stock prediction, WhatsApp bots, CRM AI  
- Ready-to-run templates: clone my repos for quick starts  
- GenAI in retail: personalized marketing, customer support assistants, demand forecasting
